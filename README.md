## Assignment from Exercise session 7

##### Use tidyr and dplyr libraries whenever possible, to do the following:

### **Task 1:** Load the “iris” dataset and transform it to longer.

- tip: you should get 3 columns Species | Trait | Size

### **Task 2:** Answer the following questions.

- tip: you can answer each question “piping” only 2-3 commands

#### **Task 2.1:** What is the mean length and width of the sepal and petal of each species?

#### **Task 2.2:** What is the largest and widest,  petal and sepal,  of virginica and versicolor species?

#### **Task 2.3:** For each species, for sepal and petal width and length, how many observations are above the mean?*

- tip: adding the means as column might help

*Might seem difficult (it is not that difficult if you know the tricks ;) ). If you don’t manage to make it work, submit your best attempts and we will discuss it in class.

### **Task 3:** Deliver a link to GitHub containing the a Quarto file and the compiled HTML. It should contain explanations of what each chunk does. If you have private repository, remember to send me invitation so I can access it .
